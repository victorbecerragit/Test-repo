mkdir networking101
cd networking101
gsutil cp gs://networking101/* .

if you list files in the networking101 folder you should see a set of .yaml and .jinja files used for simpler deployment of resources. 
Now create the initial deployment with the following command:


gcloud deployment-manager deployments create networking101  \
--config networking-lab.yaml

google745339_student@qwiklabs-gcp-19e1e487a1318529:~/networking101$ gcloud deployment-manager deployments create networking101  \
> --config networking-lab.yaml

Note: If you check out the Deployment Manager script you can see that the w2-vm has the internal IP manually set to 10.11.0.100 while all the other IPs are automatically assigned.

Try to connect to one of the VMs by clicking on the SSH button on the Console.

After a long wait, you should see that the connection fails with an error message like this:

Connection Failed
We are unable to connect to the VM on port 22. Learn more about possible causes of this issue.

This is because there are not Firewall rules defined for standard ports *22,3399,icmp,etc.
"As the default policy inside a network *VPC* is deny, all traffic is currently disallowed by the firewalls."

Since we will manually create firewall rules later in the lab, for now we will adjust our Deployment Manager script to allow all traffic inside the network as well as SSH and ICMP from anywhere.

Then add the following code snippet to the bottom of the file:

networking-lab-snippet.yaml
# Add this to the bottom of networking-lab.yaml to enable the
# firewalling configuration


- name: networking-firewall
  type: firewall-template.jinja
  properties:
    network: networking101
    
cat networking-lab-snippet.yaml >> networking-lab.yaml 

Now, update the deployment with the following command:

gcloud deployment-manager deployments update networking101 \
--config networking-lab.yaml

google745339_student@qwiklabs-gcp-19e1e487a1318529:~/networking101$ gcloud deployment-manager deployments update networking101 \
